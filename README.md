# MANO Resources  

**Teaching material shared by teachers and made publicly available to MANO students.**  

This repository contains folders for each teacher. Inside their folder, they upload their PDFs and other teaching materials. All materials automatically appear on the MANO Resources website.  


## Overview  

- Each teacher has **one personal folder**.  
- The folder name must end with a unique **identifier**  
  - **ORCID (preferred)**  
  - or **VIAF**  
  - or **GND**  
- Inside the folder, upload your **PDFs (or other files)**.  
- Submit your changes ‚Üí Your materials go live on the website.

## What happens next?  

The system automatically:  
  - Detects your ORCID (or VIAF/GND)
  - Retrieves your **correct name** from the identifier
  - Lists all your PDFs in a searchable table on the [Resources section](https://mano-project.github.io/resources.html) of the MANO website 


## FAQ  

**1. I don‚Äôt have an ORCID. Can I still upload?**  
Yes. Use your VIAF or GND ID. If you have none, just use:  Surname Name Affiliation/README.md
Your folder name will appear directly on the website.  

**2. What if I paste the full ORCID URL?**  
No problem. The system extracts the correct identifier automatically.  

**3. Can I organize my materials into subfolders?**  
Yes! The website will still list all PDFs, even inside subfolders.  


## Best Practices  

- Always include an identifier at the end of your folder name followed by /README.md.  
- Use clear, descriptive filenames for your PDFs (e.g., `Introduction-to-TEI.pdf`).  
- If you update materials later, just upload new files to your same folder.
